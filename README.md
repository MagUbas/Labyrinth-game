## Motivation  <br />
  This was my first "bigger"  project in JavaScript. <br />
  My goal was to: <br />
  - teach myslef how javascript works in conecction to css and html files
  - understand basic javascript logic
  - make something fun :)

 ## How to navigate this project <br />

 This is a pretty straightforward project. It is a small labyrinth game, <br />
 that can be played on 6 different difficulty levels. <br />
 Labyrinth is made using Prim's algorithm.

 ## If I had more time I would: <br />
 - Make it more visually appealing.  
 - Fix visual error on 25 rows/columns size board
 - Make it responsive on phones/tablets
