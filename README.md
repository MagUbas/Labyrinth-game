How i worked on this project
  This was my first "bigger"  project in JavaScript.
  My goal was to:
  - teach myslef how javascript works in conecction to css and html files
  - understand basic javascript logic
  - make something fun :)

How to navigate this project
 This is pretty straightforward project. It is a small labyrinth game ,
 that can be played on 6 different game boards sizes / diffculty levels.

If i had more time I would change this
 -Make it more visually appealing. 
 -Fix visuall error on 25 rows/columns size board
